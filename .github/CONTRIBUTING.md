# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome, both reporting issues and submitting pull requests!

## Reporting issues

- What version of the crate are you using? If it's not the latest, try seeing if the problem is still present on the latest commit on the _main_ branch.

## Submitting pull requests

We will gladly accept bug fixes, or additions to this library. Please fork this library, commit and push your changes, and open a pull request.

- If you plan to work on something major, please open an issue to discuss the design first.
- Don't break backwards compatibility. If you really have to, open an issue to discuss this first.
- Run `make fmt`
